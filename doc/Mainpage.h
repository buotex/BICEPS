Using the binary, just place it in a convenient location, take care that the \c Models
folder is in the same place.


\subsection sec_install_src Building from Source
The following illustrates how to build the examples, tests and
distribution packages. Bundling \c libfbi requires a working CMake build system
(available from http://cmake.org/) and CMake >= 2.6.

With cmake in the system path, the build process is
\verbatim
 tar xvzf biceps-xxxxxxx.tar.gz
 mkdir biceps
 cd biceps
 ccmake ../biceps
 make
\endverbatim
And, optionally:
\verbatim
 make package
\endverbatim
