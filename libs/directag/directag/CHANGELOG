	  * refactored scanInfo and BaseSpectrum::scanId to SpectrumId and BaseSpectrum::id
	  * switch from LibMSR to ProteoWizard for MS data reading (and soon writing too!)
	  * switched to use optional ostream pointer to provide qonversion details instead of global variable
	  * switched to use optimized_lexical_cast in ProteoWizard

	- DirecTag
	  * updated TagFile output to include Zeqiang's requested fields and use mzML-style attributes
	  * updated usage line to reflect support for generic MS formats
